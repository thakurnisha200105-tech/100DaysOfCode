# QuizBrain has two attribute :- question_number = 0 and questions_list , Methods : next_question() and add one more methods that is : still_has_question() and again add one more method that : check_answer()


#1

# Create a class called QuizBrain. Write an __init__() method., Initialise the question_number to 0. Initialise the question_list to an input.

class QuizBrain:
    def __init__(self, q_list):
        self.question_number = 0
        self.score = 0 # 4 
        self.question_list = q_list

#3
# Create method called still_has_questions(). Return a boolean depending on the value of question_number. Use the While loop to show the next question until the end. 
    def still_has_question(self):
        # if self.question_number < len(self.question_list) # we have 12 question in our question bank so then len : 12 
        #     return True
        # else:
        #     False
        
         return self.question_number < len(self.question_list)
#2

    # Retrieve the item at the current question_number from the question_list.
    # Use the input() function to show the user the Question text and ask for the user's answer
        
    
    def next_question(self):
        current_question = self.question_list[self.question_number]
        self.question_number += 1

        user_answer = input(f"Q.{self.question_number}:{current_question.text} (True/false):")
        self.check_answer(user_answer, current_question.answer)
#4
# Create new method : check_answer(). 
    def check_answer(self, user_answer, correct_answer):
